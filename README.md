# Wordle Clone (React + Vite)

A fun clone of the popular **Wordle** game built with **React** and **Vite**! ðŸŽ‰  

This project allowed me to experiment with advanced React concepts and create a polished, interactive experience.

## Features

- **React Hooks & APIs:** Utilizes `useImperativeHandle`, Context API, `createPortal`, and memoization for performance optimizations.
- **Animations:** Smooth animations including fireworks for winning the game (adapted from [this JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/elin/7m3bL/)).
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile.
- **Fun Gameplay:** Try to guess the word in 6 attempts!
